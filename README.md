# Assignment 1
Estimating the area of Mandelbrot set with monte carlo integration

## Prerequisite
Python >3.10

## How to Run
📋 Clone the project
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nabilasiregar/stochastic-simulation
```

📁 Go to the project directory
```bash
  cd stochastic-simulation
```

💻 Run the main file
```bash
  python Engels_14947994_Sahrani_12661651_Siregar_1486305.py
```
**Note:** _we cannot rename the file to Engels_14947994_Sahrani_12661651_Siregar_1486305_Assignment1.py because git would treat it as a completely new file without the previous commit history and we do not want that because we need it to count contribution using git-fame_

⏳ Run the simulation (optional)
```bash
  python simulation.py
```
❗Running the simulation is computationally expensive and will take **at least** one hour. For convenience, we provide the pre-generated datasets under the 'data' directory. 

📈 Reproduce plots that are presented in our report
```bash
  python plotting.py
```
All plots can be found in the 'assets' folder. If you run the simulation, the csv file will also be saved under assets.

📊 Run the statistical tests
```bash
  python analysis.py
```
