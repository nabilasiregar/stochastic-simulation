# Assignment 1
Estimating the area of Mandelbrot set with monte carlo integration

## Prerequisite
Python >3.10

## How to Run
📋 Clone the project
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/nabilasiregar/stochastic-simulation
```

Go to the project directory
```bash
  cd stochastic-simulation
```

💻 Run the main file
```bash
  python Engels_14947994_Sahrani_12661651_Siregar_1486305.py
```

**Note:** _we cannot rename the file to Engels_14947994_Sahrani_12661651_Siregar_1486305_Assignment1.py because git would treat it as a completely new file without the previous commit history and we do not want that because we need it to count contribution using git-fame_

⏳ Run the simulation
```bash
  python simulation.py
```

❗Running the simulation is computationally expensive and will take at least one hour. For convenience, we have provided the datasets under the 'data' directory. 

📈 To reproduce the plots presented in our report, run
```bash
  python plotting.py
```
