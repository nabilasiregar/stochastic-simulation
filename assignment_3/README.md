# Assignment 3
Solving Traveling Salesman Problem using Simulated Annealing

## How to Run
üìÅ Go to the project directory
```bash
  cd stochastic-simulation/assignment_3
```

‚è≥ Run the simulation (optional)
```bash
  python simulation.py
```
You will be prompted to choose what kind of simulation to run from your terminal: `general`, `cooling_factor`, `cooling_factor_fast` or `markov chain`.

+ `general`: Run all simulated annealing types (Simulated Annealing, List-Based Simulated Annealing, Fast Simulated Annealing)
+ `cooling_factor`: Run regular simulated annealing with varying cooling factors
+ `cooling_factor_fast`: Run fast simulated annealing with varying cooling factors
+ `markov_chain`: Run regular simulated annealing with varying Markov chain length

All csv files generated from simulation run will be saved under the root of assignment_3 folder.
For convenience, we provide the pre-generated datasets under the 'data' folder. 

üìä Reproduce figures and stats that are presented in our report 
```bash
  python analysis.py
```
